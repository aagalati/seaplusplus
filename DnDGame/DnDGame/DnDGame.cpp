--------------------------Part 2: MapObserver---------------------------
Adam Galati 26944094

This program uses the DnDGame.cpp as the driver. The code has the observer pattern
implemented (Subject and Observer as a superclass are used), this observer pattern
will notify all the observable objects when a Subject::Notify has been called.
This program uses the SFML library (available at www.sfml-dev.org) to create a 
graphical user interface (GUI) for the map of the game.

Libraries used:

	-SFML Library: This library was used because is it a flexible way to implement
				  a GUI. It allows for images to imported as textures which is
				  useful when creating a game. The SFML libraries allows for good
				  visual and audio which makes it a great platform for this game.
	
	-Vector:	Vectors are a good way of keeping a list of data, this program uses
				mostly 2D vectors. Vectors will throw exceptions for out of bounds
				which is helpful for debugging as arrays would not behave the same.

	-iostream:	Used mostly for debugging purposes, but it is a fallback to the GUI
				as all the information on the GUI is represented in ASCII in the 
				console.

	-String:	Used for manipulating strings


Important info:

	To install SFML:	1- Visit http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php and download Visual C++ 14 (2015) - 64-bit

						2- After downloading, extract the files onto the C drive

						3- The file is typically named SFML-2.4.1 however in this application rename it to SFML 2.4.1 (ex. C:\SFML 2.4.1)

						4-The code should now work, if the error persists it could be an issue with include or library path
						  If the code cannot be run after troubleshooting, contact galati_ator@msn.com (my email) if you would
						  like to get it to work. 
						 (This tutorial is extremely helpful http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/95295/#msg511543 see 9) Configure Visual Studio)


Relevant changes since Assignment 1:
	-GUI:
		-DnDgame.cpp
	-Observer Pattern:
		-Subject class (Subject.h & Subject.cpp)
		-Observer class (Oberser.h)
		-Grid::Update()
		-GridObserver

Game Rules:
	-Player can move
	-Map had entrance and exit

Future goals:
	-Implement A* pathing for any character/enemy and for better optimized Grid::checkValid()
