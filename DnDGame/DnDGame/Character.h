/*!\brief 1) Game Rules Implemented
			A character is made up of 6 core ability statistics, a level statistics, hitpoints and
			additional combat information and can also equip items.

			For ability points, the generation is done as follows, as per the rules :
			-The 3 best out of 4 rolls of a 6 sided die generates a value.
			- This process is repeated 6 times, such that 6 values are generated.
			- A player who creates a character would usually apply those stats as he desires.To
			  avoid further user interaction, I have decided to hand the best statistics to the
			  attributes which are most desirable to the Fighter Class, and the worst statistic
			  to the attributs which are not as desirable.
			- At certain levels, players are given additional ability points, which they can
			  assign as they wish.In this implementation, extra points are given in accordance
			  to the level given in the constructor.
			- All of this is impletemented in the abilityScoreGenerator.

			For abilitiy modifiers, the values of the modifiers are related to the value of the
			respective ability point.As such, every ability point goes through a switch case,
			such that the ability modifiers respect the DnD guidelines.

			For hitpoints, this value depends on the level of the character.At level 1, hitPoints are
			equal to 10 plus the Constitution modifier.For every additional level, the play rolls a d10
			and add his constitution modifier to the roll.In this implementation, the hitpoints assigned
			depend on the level chosen during character creation.

			For the combat related statistics :
			- The Armor Class is 10 + the Dexterity modifier.
			- The Melee Attack Bonus and Damage are equal to the Strength modifier
			- The Ranged Attack Bonus and Damare are equal to the Dexterity modifier.

			For the equipment, it is simply represented by string values.I was however still
			conscious of the starting gear of a fighter, such that he starts with basic equipment.
			2) Design
			In the driver, the a character can be created by calling the Character constructor. Arguments
			can be used such that the level of the character can be chosen, as well as its name. The
			Abilities Points can be selected or they can be randomly generated in a way that would
			favor a Character of class Fighter.
			When the constructor is called, the level is either set to 1 or one chosen which respects
			the dungeons and dragons guideling. Then the statistics are either generated or immediately
			set depending on the constructor called. The generation is done through many iterations of
			the rand() function. When all the statistics have been initliazed to the character, they are
			printed to the console. The program is then finished.

			3) Libraries used

			cstdlib:   This library is specifically used for the rand() function, which is used for the 
				       generation of the ability points. Specifically, the scope of the namespace std is
					   thus reduced to the function rand();
			iostream:  This library is used for the cout function, for printing the character information
					   to the screen. I limited the scope of the namespace to cout while excluding cin,
					   since I did not design my program with user interaction through the console. I 
					   assume that for the scope of this assignment, modifying the code in the Driver is 
					   sufficient.
			string:	   This library allows to usage and manipulation of strings, which are used for
					   implementing the equipment and the name of the character. I tried to limit the 
					   scope to increase efficiency but was having difficulties printing string information
					   to the console without using the entire library.
			afx:	   Necessary for Serialization.
